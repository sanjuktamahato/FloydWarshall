# FloydWarshall
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming technique used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It works with both positive and negative edge weights (but no negative cycles), updating path costs by considering all possible intermediate nodes.
